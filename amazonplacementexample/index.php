            <h1>What are T Levels?</h1>
            <p>T levels are a Level 3 qualification in the UK, they are somewhat of a compromise between BTEC's and A Levels. They have some exams similar to A Levels,
                However also some more practical work. They are however different as T Levels include 315 require of work experience to pass. This overall makes them a good balance
                of everything.</p>

            <h1>Who are T Levels for?</h1>
            <p>T Levels are designed for students between the age of 16-19. They are aimed at students who are more interested in real world experience
                than learning content for an exam. They are also better for people who may perform badly under the stress of exams, as T Levels are less exam focused.</p>

            <h1>T Levels at Amazon</h1>
            <p>Amazon is becoming increasingly involved with T Level courses. We are taking 100s of students to complete 3 weeks of their placement.
                The placement allows students to gain experience of working with amazon in small teams, and simultaneously helps prepare students for
                their Occupational Specialism.
                Completing the placement with Amazon also increases your chances of being offered an Amazon Apprenticeship after completing your course.</p>
